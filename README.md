# Forest Website (project0 of the HarvardX CS50 course)

This project taught me a lot about utilising various tools to make development easier on developers.
The website is albeit quite useless, but is my first foray into multi-page website creation. It was great to get practice with maintaining a style and using Sass and Bootstrap to make coding simpler.

The files:
* img
  * A folder containing all the images used in the Website
* style.css.map
  * the file used in compiling my SCSS file and my CSS file
* style.css
  * the linked stylesheet compiled from my SCSS file
* style.scss
  * the Sass file used to style the website
* script.js
  * the linked JavaScript file used in creating the responsive navbar
* README.md
  * a description of the project, each file and what was learned
* home.html
  * the home page for my website
  * contains a carousel of website related images
* trees.html
  * a collage of tree images with a corresponding table describing each
* mushrooms.html
  * a collage of mushroom images with a corresponding table describing each
* moss.html
  * a collage of moss images with a corresponding table describing each

What I learned:
* how to use SCSS
  * using inheritance
  * creating variables
* how to use Bootstrap
  * grid structure
  * preset classes
* better understanding of class vs id
